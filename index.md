# Welcome to the guide to make proportional icons on Google Earth!
In this guide I will cover how to make proportional icons in a KML icon in Google Earth. This is useful in multiple ways, such as visualizing bedload size in multiple locations (my use case), population data (check Credits, example of that is used here), and earthquake magnitude data.

## Prerequisites 
1. Download the template [here](https://github.com/jamieernest/Proportional_Earth_Icons/releases/download/1.0/water_of_leith_bedload_size_2021_4GGA.kml)
2. Coordinates of locations. If you are not sure, just [create](https://www.google.com/maps/d/mp?hl=en&authuser=0&state=create) a Google custom Map.

The coordinates should be in blocks like this:<br>

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jamieernest/Proportional_Earth_Icons/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
